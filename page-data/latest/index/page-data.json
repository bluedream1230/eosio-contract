Core blockchain features such as consensus, fee schedules, account creation and modification, token economics, block producer registration, voting, multi-sig, etc., are implemented inside smart contracts which are deployed on the blockchain built on the EOSIO platform.</p>\n<p>Block.one implements and maintains EOSIO open source platform which contains, as an example, the system contracts encapsulating the base functionality for an EOSIO based blockchain. This document will detail each one of them, <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiobios-system-contract\">eosio.bios</a>, <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiosystem-system-contract\">eosio.system</a>, <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiomsig-system-contract\">eosio.msig</a>, <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiotoken-system-contract\">eosio.token</a>, <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiowrap-system-contract\">eosio.wrap</a> along with a few other main concepts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concepts\">Concepts</h2>\n<h3 id=\"system-contracts-system-accounts-priviledged-accounts\">System contracts, system accounts, priviledged accounts</h3>\n<p>At the genesis of an EOSIO based blockchain, there is only one account present: eosio, which is the main system account. There are other system accounts, which are created by eosio, and control specific actions of the system contracts mentioned earlier. Note that we are introducing the notion of system contract/s and system account/s. Also note that privileged accounts are accounts which can execute a transaction while skipping the standard authorization check. To ensure that this is not a security hole, the permission authority over these accounts is granted to eosio.prods.</p>\n<p>As you just learned the relation between an account and a contract, we are adding here that not all system accounts contain a system contract, but each system account has important roles in the blockchain functionality, as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Account</th>\n<th>Priviledged</th>\n<th>Has contract</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>It contains the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.system</code> contract</td>\n<td>The main system account on an EOSIO based blockchain.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio.msig</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>It contains the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.msig</code> contract</td>\n<td>Allows the signing of a multi-sig transaction proposal for later execution if all required parties sign the proposal before the expiration time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio.wrap</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>It contains the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.wrap</code> contract.</td>\n<td>Simplifies block producer superuser actions by making them more readable and easier to audit.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio.token</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>It contains the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.token</code> contract.</td>\n<td>Defines the structures and actions allowing users to create, issue, and manage tokens on EOSIO based blockchains.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio.names</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The account which is holding funds from namespace auctions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>eosio.bpay</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>The account that pays the block producers for producing blocks.

If your contract needs to store data on the blockchain, like in a database, then it can store it in the blockchain's RAM using either a multi-index table, which can be found explained <a href=\"https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/v1.3.1/docs/db-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/using-multi-index-tables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> or a singleton, its definition can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/blob/develop/libraries/eosiolib/singleton.hpp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> and a sample of its usage <a href=\"https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/3fddb727b8f3615917707281dfd3dd3cc5d3d66d/contracts/eosio.system/eosio.system.hpp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nThe EOSIO-based blockchains are known for their high performance, which is achieved also because the data stored on the blockchain is using RAM as the storage medium, and thus access to blockchain data is very fast, helping the performance benchmarks to reach levels no other blockchain has been able to.\nRAM is a very important resource because of the following reasons: it is a limited resource, each EOSIO-based blockchain can have a different policy and rules around RAM, for example the public EOS blockchain started with 64GB of RAM and after that the block producers decided to increase the memory with 1KiB (1024 bytes) per day, thus increasing constantly the supply of RAM for the price of RAM to not grow too high because of the increased demand from blockchain applications; also RAM it is used in executing many actions that are available on the blockchain, creating a new account for example (it needs to store in the blockchain memory the new account's information), also when an account accepts a new type of token a new record has to be created somewhere in the blockchain memory that holds the balance of the new token accepted, and that memory, the storage space on the blockchain, has to be purchased either by the account that transfers the token or by the account that accepts the new token type.\nRAM is a scarce resource priced according to the unique Bancor liquidity algorithm which is implemented in the system contract <a href=\"https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/905e7c85714aee4286fa180ce946f15ceb4ce73c/contracts/eosio.system/exchange_state.hpp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cpu\">CPU</h3>\n<p>CPU is processing power, the amount of CPU an account has is measured in microseconds, it is referred to as \"cpu bandwidth\" on the cleos get account command output and represents the amount of processing time an account has at its disposal when pushing actions to a contract.</p>\n<h3 id=\"net\">NET</h3>\n<p>As CPU and RAM, NET is also a very important resource in EOSIO-based blockchains. NET is the network bandwidth measured in bytes of transactions and it is referred to as \"net bandwidth\" on the cleos get account command. This resource like CPU must be staked so that a contract's transactions can be executed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stake\">Stake</h3>\n<p>On EOSIO based blockchains, to be able to deploy and then interact with a smart contract via its implemented actions it needs to be backed up by resources allocated on the account where the smart contract is deployed to. The three resource types an EOSIO smart contract developer needs to know about are RAM, CPU and NET. You can <strong>stake</strong> CPU and NET and you can <strong>buy</strong> RAM. You will also find that staking/unstaking is at times referred to as delegating/undelegating. The economics of staking is also to provably commit to a promise that you'll hold the staked tokens, either for NET or CPU, for a pre-established period of time, in spite of inflation caused by minting new tokens in order to reward BPs for their services every 24 hours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vote\">Vote</h3>\n<p>In a EOSIO-based network the blockchain is kept alive by nodes which are interconnected into a mesh, communicating with each other via peer to peer protocols. Some of these nodes are elected, via a <strong>voting</strong> process, by the token holders to be producer nodes. They produce blocks, validate them and reach consensus on what transactions are allowed in each block, their order, and what blocks are finalized and stored forever in the blockchain memory. This way the governance, the mechanism by which collective decisions are made, of the blockchain is achieved through the 21 active block producers which are appointed by token holders' <strong>votes</strong>. It's the 21 active block producers which continuously create the blockchain by creating blocks, and securing them by validating them, and reaching consensus. Consensus is reached when 2/3+1 active block producers agree on validity of a block, that is all transactions contained in it and their order.</p>\n<h2 id=\"system-contracts-defined-in-eosiocontracts\">System contracts defined in eosio.contracts</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiobios-system-contract\">eosio.bios</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiosystem-system-contract\">eosio.system</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiomsig-system-contract\">eosio.msig</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiotoken-system-contract\">eosio.token</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/build-and-deploy/#eosiowrap-system-contract\">eosio.wrap</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"eosiobios-system-contract\">eosio.bios system contract</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.bios</code> is the first sample of system smart contract provided by <code class=\"language-text\">block.one</code> through the EOSIO platform. It is a minimalist system contract because it only supplies the actions that are absolutely critical to bootstrap a chain and nothing more. This allows for a chain agnostic approach to bootstrapping a chain.</p>\n<p>The actions implemented and publicly exposed by <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.bios</code> system contract are: setpriv, setalimits, setglimits, setprods, setparams, reqauth, setabi.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Action name</th>\n<th>Action description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>setpriv</td>\n<td>Set privilege status for an account.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>setalimits</td>\n<td>Set the resource limits of an account</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>setglimits</td>\n<td>Not implemented yet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>setprods</td>\n<td>Set a new list of active producers, that is, a new producers' schedule.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>setparams</td>\n<td>Set the blockchain parameters.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>reqauth</td>\n<td>Check if an account has authorization to access the current action.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>setabi</td>\n<td>Set the abi for a contract identified by an account name.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The above actions are enough to serve the functionality of a basic blockchain, however, a keen eye would notice that the actions listed above do not allow for creation of an account, nor updating permissions, and other important features. As we mentioned earlier, this sample system contract is minimalist in its implementation, therefore it relies also on some native EOSIO actions. These native actions are not implemented in the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.bios</code> system contract, they are implemented at the EOSIO chain core level. In the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.bios</code> contract they are simply declared and have no implementation, so they can show in the contracts ABI definition, and therefore users can push these actions to the account that holds the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.bios</code> contract.

If all validations succeed, it debits the specified amount of tokens from the total balance.|</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.token</code> sample contract demonstrates one way to implement a smart contract which allows for creation and management of tokens. This contract gives anyone the ability to create a token. It is possible for one to create a similar contract which suits different needs.  However, it is recommended that if one only needs a token with the above listed actions, that one uses the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.token</code> contract instead of developing their own.</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.token</code> contract class also implements two useful public static methods: <code class=\"language-text\">get_supply</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">get_balance</code>. The first allows one to check the total supply of a specified token, created by an account and the second allows one to check the balance of a token for a specified account (the token creator account has to be specified as well).</p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.token</code> contract manages the set of tokens, accounts and their corresponding balances, by using two internal multi-index structures: the <code class=\"language-text\">accounts</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">stats</code>. The <code class=\"language-text\">accounts</code> multi-index table holds, for each row, instances of <code class=\"language-text\">account</code> object and the <code class=\"language-text\">account</code> object holds information about the balance of one token. If we remember how multi-index tables work, see <a href=\"https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/using-multi-index-tables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, then we understand also that the <code class=\"language-text\">accounts</code> table is scoped to an eosio account, and it keeps the rows indexed based on the token's symbol.  This means that when one queries the <code class=\"language-text\">accounts</code> multi-index table for an account name the result is all the tokens that account holds at the moment.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the <code class=\"language-text\">stats</code> multi-index table, holds instances of <code class=\"language-text\">currency_stats</code> objects for each row, which contains information about current supply, maximum supply, and the creator account for a symbol token. The <code class=\"language-text\">stats</code> table is scoped to the token symbol.  Therefore, when one queries the <code class=\"language-text\">stats</code> table for a token symbol the result is one single entry/row corresponding to the queried symbol token if it was previously created, or nothing, otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eosiowrap-system-contract\">eosio.wrap system contract</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.wrap</code> system contract allows block producers to bypass authorization checks or run privileged actions with 15/21 producer approval and thus simplifies block producers superuser actions. It also makes these actions easier to audit.</p>\n<p>It does not give block producers any additional powers or privileges that do not already exist within the EOSIO based blockchains. As it is implemented, in an EOSIO based blockchain, 15/21 block producers can change an account's permissions or modify an account's contract code if they decided it is beneficial for the blockchain and community. </p>\n<p>However, the current method is opaque and leaves undesirable side effects on specific system accounts, and thus the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.wrap</code>contract solves this matter by providing an easier method of executing important governance actions.</p>\n<p>The only action implemented by the <code class=\"language-text\">eosio.wrap</code> system contract is the <code class=\"language-text\">exec</code> action. This action allows for execution of a transaction, which is passed to the <code class=\"language-text\">exec</code> method in the form of a packed transaction in json format via the 'trx' parameter and the <code class=\"language-text\">executer</code> account that executes the transaction. The same <code class=\"language-text\">executer</code> account will also be used to pay the RAM and CPU fees needed to execute the transaction.</p>\n<p>Why is it easier for governance actions to be executed via this contract?\nThe answer to this question is explained in detailed <a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/./guides/how-to-use-eosio.wrap/\">here</a></p>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#about-system-contracts\">About System Contracts</a></li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#concepts\">Concepts</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#system-contracts-system-accounts-priviledged-accounts\">System contracts, system accounts, priviledged accounts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#ram\">RAM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#cpu\">CPU</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#net\">NET</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#stake\">Stake</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#vote\">Vote</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#system-contracts-defined-in-eosiocontracts\">System contracts defined in eosio.contracts</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#eosiobios-system-contract\">eosio.bios system contract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#eosiosystem-system-contract\">eosio.system system contract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#eosiomsig-system-contract\">eosio.msig system contract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#eosiotoken-system-contract\">eosio.token system contract</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/eosio.contracts/latest/index/#eosiowrap-system-contract\">eosio.wrap system contract</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"edit_link":null,"request_changes_link":null},"fields":{"articleTitle":"NULL","contentTitle":"Latest","headTagTitle":"","internalSummary":"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/thorka-0.1-py3.7.egg/src/lib/gatsby/data/latest/SUMMARY.json","isCollection":false,"isRoot":true,"isTagged":true,"organization":"EOSIO","originalKey":"/","pathData":"{\"tagged\":true,\"parentPath\":\"latest\",\"collectionPath\":\"/\",\"rootDirPath\":\"latest\",\"filename\":\"index.md\"}","repository":"eosio.contracts","showSearch":true,"slug":"/latest/index","tagsList":"[{\"beta\":false,\"build\":false,\"deprecated\":false,\"latest\":true,\"rc\":false,\"tag\":\"v1.8.0\",\"tag_reduced\":\"1.8\",\"tag_reduced_friendly\":\"v1.8\",\"tag_sanitized\":\"1.8.0\",\"summaryPath\":\"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/thorka-0.1-py3.7.egg/src/lib/gatsby/data/latest/SUMMARY.json\",\"importedSummary\":\"N/A\",\"version\":\"latest\"}]","latestDDVersion":"latest","importedSummary":"N/A","hasPrimaryNavigation":false,"primaryNavData":"[{\"text\":\"NONE\",\"path\":\"EMPTY\"}]","currentVersion":"latest","currentDDVersion":"1.8","summaryJson":"{\"array\":[{\"title\":\"Build And Deploy\",\"link\":\"build-and-deploy.md\"},{\"sub\":[{\"title\":\"Upgrading The Eosio.system Contract\",\"link\":\"guides/upgrading-the-eosio.system-contract.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Buy Ram\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-buy-ram.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Stake\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-stake.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Vote\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-vote.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Create Issue And Transfer A Token\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-create-issue-and-transfer-a-token.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Sign A Multisig Transaction With Eosio.msig\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-sign-a-multisig-transaction-with-eosio.msig.md\"},{\"title\":\"How To Use Eosio.wrap\",\"link\":\"guides/how-to-use-eosio.wrap.md\"}],\"title\":\"Guides\"},{\"sub\":[{\"sub\":[],\"title\":\"eosio.bios\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.bios\"},{\"sub\":[],\"title\":\"eosio.msig\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.msig\"},{\"sub\":[{\"title\":\"native\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.system/native.md\"},{\"title\":\"rex.results\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.system/rex.results.md\"}],\"title\":\"eosio.system\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.system\"},{\"sub\":[],\"title\":\"eosio.token\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.token\"},{\"sub\":[],\"title\":\"eosio.wrap\",\"link\":\"action-reference/eosio.wrap\"}],\"title\":\"Action Reference\"}],\"title\":[]}"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/latest/index"}}}
